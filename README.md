# Quality Assurance Metric Application

This is a project made with Flutter for a Software Testing and Validation class at the U of R. 


## Overview

A fictional company, No-Risk Software Inc., has a manager perform qualitative analysis
to assess the risk of projects by finding appropriate quality metrics, creating four ‘bins’,
corresponding to the classes of ‘minimal risk’, ‘low risk’, ‘reasonable risk’ and ‘high risk’
and polling the team to see how many members believe that the project is in each of
the four bins for each metric. Based on the votes, the project is assessed based on risk
by each metric, and the project status overall is also assessed.

## Design phases
Phase 1: Replicate the functionality of the spreadsheet, including the metrics currently included

Phase 2: Add the ability to add additional quality metrics to the application. All metrics and bin descriptions should be editable.

Future phases: Add a database and allow multiple users to collaborate on the assessment in real time. Add user and administrator roles.

## Running the app locally

Follow the steps outlined in [Flutter's getting started documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). Essentially, you will need to download the Flutter SDK, add it to your path, and then you will be able to run flutter run in your terminal.
